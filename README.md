An overly complicated game of Tic Tac Toe built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The mechanism for figuring out the status of the game (win/lose/draw) very unnecessarily (big waste of time) uses magic numbers and a recursive combination finding algorithm to determine if any move led to a player winning or drawing the game.

Will be updated to include a `Player VS Bot` version, with an unbeatable AI based on the Minimax algorithm.


TODO :

    > Upgrade bot to use the Minimax algorithm.
